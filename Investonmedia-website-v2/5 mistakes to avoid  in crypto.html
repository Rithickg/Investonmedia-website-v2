            <h2>FOMO</h2>
            <br>
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1600787449405-cfed74773992?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=863&q=80" alt="mistakes">
            <br>
            <p>As you invest more into crypto odds are you're eventually going to see some gains on one of your investments I hope so anyway and it's important being caml. A lot of beginners know that you know panic selling isn't always the best idea but
                there's the opposite of that as well and that's excitement buying or more commonly known as FOMO the fear of missing out so similar to how someone might panic sell when their investment drops 20 someones might get excited when their investment
                jumps up 20 and then you start getting these thoughts raising your head like what if it keeps going what if it goes up to 60 should I buy more you know what if it doesn't last when the time comes that you see some gains just make sure
                that your decisions again align with your original goal and your plan that you set for yourself and you will know the answers to all of those questions so again just stick to your investment plan and that's it stick to your investment
                plan.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Use a legitimate exchange</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                So while most beginners use something safe and well-known like coinbase there are a lot of scam exchanges out there so when you're first starting out and signing up for an exchange just make sure it is a legitimate one. So do your research make sure it
                is totally safe before trusting them with your money because you are trusting them there is a custodial risk. There are many stories of exchanges losing investors money make sure you're going somewhere reputable.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2> your own research</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                crypto has been a hot topic with everyone including influencers and celebrities and I mean not long ago Kim Kardashian who has like a quarter of a billion followers on Instagram promoted Ethereum max on her Instagram story no affiliation to me which dumb
                which hasn't exactly performed so well over the past few months and I don't want to say it's a scam but you know go ahead and do your own research. There's also a huge scandal of well-known youtube gamers promoting a scam coin to their
                fans and then marketing it as something to save children so the moral of the story is no matter who tells you to buy what always do your own research and be wary of fortune-tellers. people who just say this is absolutely going to happen
                the best influencers you know they might have a little bit of clickbait in their titles and in their thumbnails for you know for the youtube algorithm but in the video, they give level-headed non-hype advice that's what you should seek
                out. so moral the story do your own research because this gives you confidence in your investments because you know why you're buying not just because someone told you to buy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Using wrong address for transaction</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Some of you know probably not all of you but you're about to learn you're going to learn today crypto transactions are designed to be permanent and irreversible this means that no one has control over the network if someone had the ability to reverse
                transactions this would defeat the whole purpose of decentralization. so when you're sending crypto from one wallet to another if you're sending a large amount of money and you don't want to lose that large amount of money, it's best to
                always send a test transaction some wallets even recommend this they probably recommend it so you don't just email them right after like where'd all my money gone. So another way to avoid this mistake is by only using QR codes which is
                much harder to mess up and when copying and pasting a wallet address or even worse writing it down manually mistakes can sometimes happen so just always double and triple check your wallet addresses so you don't lose any money.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Not using two-factor authentication</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                So the crypto space is full of hackers and not all of them are going to have good intentions like that one guy who just gave back 600 million dollars that he stole who knows if he had good intentions from the first place but either way there is nothing
                more appealing to a hacker than stealing money that cannot be tracked. one of the most simple and effective measures to take in preventing your account from getting hacked is two-factor authentication.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                some exchanges force you to do this some provide even more security measures than this but regardless everyone provides the option for two-factor authorization and you need to take advantage of it. if you don't know what that is it's a form of security
                that requires two forms of identifying yourself before they give you access to your account this is most commonly done with a text message code but even that isn't always perfect so I would highly recommend setting up an authenticator
                app like google authenticator.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                These apps produce a new code every few seconds that you then enter into a website that you're trying to log into and then you get to access this means the only way that someone could get into your account is if they both have your password and they physically
                have your phone and access to your phone and let's be honest if someone has both of those things you have way bigger problems to deal with than your cryptocurrency and where it's sitting in an exchange you've got big issues.
