            <h2> What funds are traded in ETF or EDF exchanges?</h2>

            <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/06/11/19/51/mockup-5288033_960_720.jpg" alt="ETF-Exchange Traded Fund">
            <br>
            <p>Exchange-Traded Funds or ETF is a new kid in a new investment town that has just gained popularity among Indian investors but what is ETF exchange or EDF investment fund that is a combination of mutual funds and shares such as mutual funds,
                here and there people put their money together in a fund that specializes in stocks and other securities and as single shares ETFs can be bought and sold and exchanged at any time during the day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>most ETFs are idle instruments and closely following the idle management indicator make the average cost of ETFs significantly lower than shared costs other than lower ATF costs and provide more clarity, no exit loads, and quick cash flows
                as many ETFs split again indicator should not exceed or misalign the indicator this is measured when the indicator is measured they measure ETFs as a basket now each of these baskets with security can be stocks, gold, bonds, etc.</p>
            <br>
            <b> for example ,</b>
            <p>The ICICI Prudential nifty ETF tracks a 50-point index that provides full stock market performance. Similarly, gold axis ETF tracking gold price in India there are 80 ETFs located in India tracking different security. There are 58 equity ETFs
                that include ETFs strategies based on areas such as value investing ETFs smart beta ATF's, there are also ETFs that monitor foreign exchange market performance such as Motilal Oswal small, Nasdaq 100 ETF tracking indicator of the US Nasdaq.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Why was ETF created in the firstplace ?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                ETFs have recently been introduced that track the prices of commodities known as REI, yes one of the things that makes ETFs different is that you can invest in an ETF at a cost and get some security say let's buy a Nifty index which means you have to
                buy all the shares. -50 available at Nifty which will cost you about rupees lakh right now compared to you can buy one unit of ICICI Prudential nifty ETF for just 150 rupees and get Nifty exposure index. a wonderful right, and if you think
                housing prices will rise sharply in the next two years and you want to invest in that but buying a house can cost you lakhs or maybe even caravans but with the offices of the embassy REIT-- ETF you can get real estate exposure for just
                four hundred rupees how that was the basis of the ETF.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>How the ETF came to the fore in 1990 ?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The world's first ETF was created in Canada for the purpose of tracking the Toronto 35 index in the US. The first ETF was launched in 1993 called the S&P 500 trust ATF to track the S&P 500 market index after the ETF industry saw slow and steady growth
                until 2008. in the ETF industry as low cost and other benefits of the ETF scheme in the face of investors in a time of crisis after the EDF industry saw a steady growth in total assets invested in the global ETF industry to $ 5 trillion
                in February 2009, high value assets global records under the management of ETFs have grown by 20.1% CAGR over the past decade. surprisingly u.s. is the largest market for ETFs in two commodities sizes and offers the best-selling shares
                of the NYS key not Apple, Microsoft, or Google, an ETF called SPDR that sells for $ 25 billion a day in the Indian investment space.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In 2001 the first ETF was created when a benchmark mutual fund introduced the Nifty ETF fund with the stated purpose of tracking the performance of 50 indicators in India the ETF industry is starting to rise since 2015.EDF has not only become larger not
                only but also the various assets under the management of ETFs have grown from about 13,000 800 crores in December 2014 to more than 440 lakh pounds from May 2009 the group is growing 10x under five CAGRs over 55 years , interestingly,
                most of these growths have come from the equality phase with ETFs there are many advantages but there is a perception among the people that ETFs are not a fluid tracking error and SIP is a concern for ETFs.
