            <br>
            <p>what monero is how it works and if you should consider using it now the promise of cryptocurrency is not just simplicity hard money and decentralization many people turn to cryptocurrency for privacy and monero is the king of privacy in the
                crypto world the word monero sounds like money which makes sense because it's actually the Esperanto word for coin in many ways.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                it's similar to other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin it's a proof of work blockchain with something called adaptive block size which we'll explain later but moving on to what makes monero private the simple answer here is that monero is based on some open-source
                code called crypto note now this can be used as the basis for any other private cryptocurrency but is best known for its use in monero without getting too technical because it definitely gets technical this software lets monero stay completely
                private by using a lot of different keys and something called ring signatures.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                so here's a simple way to think about it imagine if every time that you used cash app or paypal the account produced an entirely different username to send and receive money this is basically how keys work in monero you have stealth addresses which let
                you randomly generate keys every time you want to make a transaction this way people can have a target where they are sending money to so that you both know it's going in the right place but it also never reveals anything else about the
                user monero also uses something called ring signatures now these are intentionally designed to obscure who is sending or receiving payments to the general public the transaction happens and to the outside you're only able to see a total
                pool of people from whom the money could have been sent there's no way to tell who from this group actually engaged in the transaction so it's totally private this means you can't track where monero is going but it also means you can't
                see how much money the person that you're paying has unlike almost every other blockchain you can see account balances.
            </p><br>

            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581954406103-3bde2d1ee00f?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1467&q=80" alt="private, monero">
            <br>
            <p>
                well Bitcoin is more private than a bank transfer or Paypal or even a debit card purchase but it's not quite all the way there in fact bitcoins are not actually 100 fungible every bitcoin has a history of where it came from so it's not completely fungible
                you can actually track where it was mined and whose hand it has been traded to that might include a senator a drug dealer or even a big corporation at least if you can identify them in economics fungibility is the way economists determine
                whether something is actually good money all units of a currency should ideally be identical to each other.
            </p><br>
            <p>for example one pound of gold is atomically exactly similar to another pound of gold now dollar bills may have different designs or serial numbers but they are all worth the same amount one united states dollar bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies
                can be traced to a certain extent so that old coins that were used in a hack or maybe even a drug deal may be unwanted because of these past issues monero however is completely untraceable so it is actually completely fungible not just
                in terms of value but in terms of traceability monero also differs from bitcoin in a seemingly trivial but historically important way block size basically monero does not have a block size limit blocks can actually increase in size if
                there's more transactions that need verified this is the same idea as basically adding more lanes to a highway during peak traffic hours however when you increase the block size fees are lower which means people can spam the network with
                less important transactions that they normally would not make now monero gets around this problem by measuring the block size and introducing penalties if the block is too big this penalty basically decreases the reward that miners get
                for confirming a block so they will be less incentivized to mine it and if they're not incentivized transactions don't get confirmed all of these incentives keep monero running smoothly according to how much traffic there is on the network
                but economics aside the one advantage fans of monero would stress over all else is its censorship resistance through decentralization
            </p><br>
            <p>
                now there are a few things to consider here number one mining both bitcoin and monero are proof-of-work blockchains but monero is designed to be more decentralized through its mining mechanism bitcoin is mostly mined using specific expensive machines
                called ASICs . These make mining easier they're better at it they use less electricity but they are a specialized specific business that is not available to most people without a big financial investment monero, on the other hand, is mined
                mostly by CPUs which are already present in almost every computer that people have even your laptop has one when the mining power is decentralized instead of being a business the system is less susceptible to failure
            </p><br>
            <p>
                number two is a lack of transparency so to remain private monero needs to be less transparent now this lack of transparency compared to something like bitcoin is interesting in bitcoin this transparency is actually a value add it allows everybody to check
                the ledger and make sure that each node can actually verify the blockchain to make sure that nobody double spends their money but it also means that you can see where funds are moving to and from and you can analyze those patterns and
                even determine the identity of a certain wallet knowing which wallets are doing what can help you determine who is who and then determine who else they're doing business with and maybe even how much money they have this kind of transparency
                fundamentally changes how people interact and negotiate if I know that you have less money maybe you're in a desperate need of liquidity and will take less than what I would normally offer for something.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                for example, if I'm buying a car from you and you have three dollars in your account I could probably haggle a lower price but if you have a million dollars I know you might not bargain monero eliminates this problem by being private and keeps things
                at a level of transparency that we're already used to with concealed bank accounts and number three is that decentralization transfers responsibility to the individual it basically means it transfers responsibility to us because monero
                is so private the onus is on individuals to be very responsible it also means many different keys.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                now these keys keep monero private but it also makes it harder to store and use you can buy and sell monero on centralized exchanges but this makes the privacy use case just a little more complicated some people say that buying monero from KYC which is
                an acronym for know your customer or companies that require information about you they say that it defeats the purpose of this privacy now this is not quite true because individual transactions still cannot be traced on monero alone it's
                like going into the bank and taking out some cash the bank knows that you took out some cash and how much and when but if you go down to the 711 and buy a Slurpee the bank has no idea how you use that money and if the exchange was ever
                hacked all anybody could ever figure out is when you moved your monero from there to your wallet not how much and not which wallet so monero is clearly set up from the start to be an ultra-private cryptocurrency
