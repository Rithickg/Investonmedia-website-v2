            <p>
                There are a lot of important ingredients in the recipe for great investing but by far one of the most valuable important traits that an investor can possess is patience Charlie Munger says "we make money while we wait, a patient investor will almost always
                perform better than someone who's impatient".
            </p><br>
            <h2>
                let's take a look at some important distinctions between a patient investor and an impatient investor,
            </h2><br>
            <p>
                First of all patient investors know that investing is a long-term game it's a way to build up wealth over years and save toward a retirement save toward financial freedom impatient investors on the other hand tend to treat the stock market like sits a
                casino or a get-rich-quick scheme they're more worried about the money that they're going to make over the course of weeks or months than they are about the money they could potentially make over the course of years and decades the crazy
                thing about stock market investing is realizing that 95 to 99 percent of the investors in the market are impatient investors including virtually all of the people managing mutual funds trying to leverage the stock market for a short-term
                profit is almost always going to be little more than a gamble and boy do the fund managers do it they get so impatient because they're being judged against their peers and they may make money in play in the short term gain they may lose
                money but it's not their money their job is to make you money and so they play a very short-term game.
            </p><br>
            <P>
                You might as well take your money to a blackjack table as to give it to a professional fund manager in Wall Street if you're expecting to beat the market patient investors on the other hand will almost always end up making money over the long term if
                they're buying wonderful businesses even if they don't buy them on sale they recognize the power of compounding interest they use that power to safely grow their wealth as the years and the decades go by next patient investors are slow
                to buy it takes patience to hold on to a company for years or decades before you sell it but it also takes pay it's to hold your money in cash until you're able to find an ideal buying opportunity.
            </P><br>
            <p>
                Impatient investors tend to persist companies whenever they get money in their hand to purchase them with their extremely active in trying to get that money into the market they're quick to jump on the bandwagon of any trending stock they're watching
                momentum and they want to catch that momentum and have it all go up all the time and to succeed in the stock market that doesn't work you have to be willing to hold your money in cash for long periods of time and do your research and sit
                on the sidelines until a great buying opportunity presents itself now choosing the right stocks and purchasing them at a great price is an all-important key to investing success.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                However, it often takes time and effort to find these opportunities patient investors are willing to put in this time and they're willing to put in that effort in order to ensure that they're putting their money into a sure thing you got to treat investing
                like you have a punch card of maybe 20 stocks let's say 20 punches on a card and when you're done punching out all 20 of those you can't buy another stock for the rest of your life if you did that you would very likely end up saying no
                a lot more than you're gonna say yes and you would certainly become a patient investor.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588231425274-428ef2301f73?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=865&q=80" alt="time ,patience">
            <p>
                Patient investors aren't confident it's really difficult to be confident when you're gambling all the time and you know you're gambling patient investors are gonna take the time to be sure about the stocks that they're buying when you do your research
                when you learn everything there is to know about a company and when you buy when it's on sale you are going to be very confident that you're gonna make money investing you almost can't help it the value of this confidence can't be overstated.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you know that you're buying ten dollar bills for five dollars over and over again you know that it's just a matter of time before your going to get rich impatient investors, on the other hand, get burned by the stock market regularly when the momentum
                fails when they failed to do their research on a stock and when this happens it shakes their confidence and it scares them away from the market entirely and we see that happen all the time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Patient investors have no reason to fear the market even when the short-term market drop happens which it does regularly patient investors recognize that investing is a long-term gain and they maintain confidence in the fact that they are going to make
                money on their investment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now finally patient investors are rational fear and greed are two emotions that hold an enormous amount of sway over the stock market they are also the two emotions that can lead someone straight to failure when fear begins to take hold.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Impatient investors tend to panic and sell out of the companies they own when a stock price is trending up impatient investors tend to get greedy piling money into the stock and driving the price up even beyond its true value and while impatient investors
                are heavily influenced by these two emotions fear and greed obviously we're human.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Patient investors tend to be far more rational this leads them to often make the exact opposite decision that impatient investors are making when fear is driving the price of a stock down below its true value those of us who are patient investors see
                a buying opportunity we don't see a problem we see an exciting opportunity when greed is driving the price of a stock way up above its true value patient investors like me tend to take their profits off the table while everyone else continues
                throwing money at an overpriced stock.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Now when you're patient and focus on the long term it's so much easier to just take a step back and relax and not get caught up in the emotions and make a rational decision it's backed by logic and facts rather than spur the moment trying to catch that
                momentum train in the end being able to remain rational and logical about investing is one of the most important keys to your success in financial independence.
