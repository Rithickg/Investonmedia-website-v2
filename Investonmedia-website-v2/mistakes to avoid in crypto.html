                Mistakes in crypto can cost you a lot of money. Mistakes that can range all the way from losing a couple dollars to losing your entire portfolio. good news is that these are totally avoidable . let's talk about the top 5 cryptocurrency mistakes that you
                must avoid.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Not having a goal or a plan</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Arguably the most important thing to do when getting into crypto is to have a goal and have a plan. a goal being why you're investing in crypto in the first place and just ask yourself is your goal to invest in promising projects that hopefully gain a
                good return on your money in the long term or maybe your goal is to put five thousand dollars into coins and beg elon musk secretary to tell him to tweet something about that coin. you know people have different goals for different situations
                whatever your goal is you should establish that in advance which you can then use to create a plan, so once you have a goal you can make a plan. so let's say your goal is to build up a portfolio for long term. one way to meet that goal
                would be to let's say buy 100 worth of ethereum and bitcoin every single week and then on top of this your plan could say that if cryptos drop 30% in a day you won't sell anything but instead you'll triple your buy that week to 300 that
                could be a potential plan.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is the thing to remember though no plan is perfect because we don't know what the future will hold what's most important is you just simply set yourself guidelines, humans me included and i'm bad about this if there is a gray area we
                will absolutely fudge and slack if your plan is to maybe buy a hundred dollars a week you're not going to buy it every week let's be honest , i know i wouldn't i have to be honest with myself i need to write something down to actually
                do it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                So set yourself a goal and a guideline and stick to it until you decide to change that goal in guideline later and then stick to that new goal and guideline it's really that simple so here's the problem people buy crypto without a plan and they buy it
                hoping for infinite returns and then they see their portfolio down 15 one morning and these people are much more likely to panic sell right at the worst time. so go set a goal and set a plan and actually write it down you will be a better
                investor instantly if you do. it's really that easy now another way to avoid emotional selling and buying is by joining a group of investors so through when wild dips in crypto this group talk through the situation with each other and
                doing so logically to help everyone feel just a little bit less emotional and that is honestly priceless for that peace of mind.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>To avoid is price does not equal value </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This is a very common misconception that the price of a coin is what determines its value it's it's an easy mistake to make. so i don't really blame people for making this mistake if you're new to crypto because bitcoin is the top dog and bitcoin is fifty
                thousand dollars per coin you know give or take twenty thousand dollars depending on what side of the bed china woke up on that day but that's that's neither here nor there because of this though many people assume that something like
                cardano whose native token is ada is only a couple dollars is 125 000 the size of bitcoin when in reality it's only about one-tenth the size of bitcoin and this is because coins are just slices of a really big pie and some pies simply
                have more slices than others the price of a slice does not matter what's actually important is the size of the entire pie this is called the market cap.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> So the market cap is what allows us to compare the size of one coin to another that's what you want to look at not the price per coin so going back to ada and bitcoin if bitcoin is 50 000 per coin and ada is two dollars and some change per
                coin bitcoin is not 25 000 times bigger than ada you would instead take bitcoins market cap their whole pie and divide that by eight as market cap and that'd give you about 10 or 11 meaning bitcoin is 10 times larger than ada.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Now mistake number three we're calling this coin to the moon </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                so you know you know what a market cap is and now you go to the tenth page of coin market cap and you find a crypto with only a 500 000 market cap and you compare that to bitcoin's 900 billion market cap. so you think yourself i could buy this and it
                could 1.8 million times my money right well you know in theory yes that's possible but in reality very unlikely ,most likely, no almost every single coin past the top you know 100 or 200 or so will come and go at some point and you might
                be thinking you know but but shiba blew up and dogecoin blew up what if i chose another one that does the same and you could you very well could but it is unlikely you just have to remember that it's unlikely and we also need to consider
                what's called survivorship , basically what this is is we hear about the projects that blow up .</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                so it seems like there's constantly projects blowing up but in reality we just simply don't hear about the 10,000 projects that didn't go to the moon. so this is how people lose a lot of money in crypto they throw money at small projects hoping that one
                of them will be the next bitcoin and give them this early easy retirement and you know well there's nothing wrong with trying to invest in coins early you just have to understand that they're extremely high risk and being new and doing
                this is generally not a great idea especially if you're just investing solely in coins that are very small. it's kind of like just putting all your money on on 69 on the roulette table.</p>
            <br>
            <h2> Buying and Selling too much</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                when it comes to the stock market buying and selling is a bad idea as it quickly adds up your tax obligation which can really eat into your profits. With crypto it's an even worse idea not only will you accumulate taxes but you'll pay a lot in fees which
                can also eat away at your profits so unless you plan on day trading and making profits. On all your trades the buy and hold method will generally save you taxes big time in most situations so let's say you invested a hundred dollars and
                it jumped up 30 to 130 dollars, that's a great increase but then you sold your investment at 130 so you now have a 30 profit you need to pay capital gains tax on that short term capital gains tax which is probably around 20 plus a couple
                dollars in transaction fees so your 30 dollars just turned into 22 dollars and that is just one trade. So it doesn't take a whole lot for that to completely eat away your profits now one way you can reduce your fees a little bit is by
                getting off an expensive exchange like coinbase.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Leverage</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                now leverage is neither good nor bad it's just another tool when investing it's just a very powerful tool. so if you don't know what leverage is. leverage is borrowed money used to increase your exposure to an investment, so if you bought 100 worth of
                some cryptocurrency using 2x leverage you would actually be investing 200 total 100 of which is borrowed money so if your investment goes up 10 you actually gain 20 on your 100 instead of 10 but the same applies if it goes down if your
                investment goes down 10 you actually lose 20 instead of just 10 so leverage just basically adds a multiplier to both your risk and your reward so well it can be a very powerful tool for making you a lot of money just raking in the dough
                you can also completely wipe out your investment in a blink of an eye. so it's not something to trifle with it's not something to touch unless you really know what you're doing and you understand the risk that you're taking on it's just
                not something that an absolute beginner should be touching for quite a while .
