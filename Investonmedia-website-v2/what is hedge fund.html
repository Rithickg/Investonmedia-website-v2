            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460925895917-afdab827c52f?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=815&q=80" alt="hedge fund, fund management">
            <br>
            <p>
                Hedge funds is an exciting and fascinating topic provided that hedge funds are in the business of making money out of thin air figuratively speaking before we start we'll make some clarifications regarding the common legal and fee structures of alternative
                investments both hedge and private equity funds are usually set up and run as limited partnerships or LP. This type of legal structure includes general partners or GPS and limited partners LPS.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                GPS are responsible for managing a given investment fund ,they have unlimited liability LPS, on the other hand, are the investors in the fund they have limited liability and a profit share their investment. limited partnerships are usually based on tax-efficient
                locations, they aren't subject to strict regulations as they are not typically offered to the general public instead, LPS are restricted to qualified investors such as institutions and high net worth individuals .
            </p><br>
            <p>
                These investors are generally expected to be more knowledgeable and able to take higher risks. The common fee structure of alternative investment funds include a management or base fee and an incentive or performance fee. The management fee is calculated
                annually on assets under management or AUM. The incentive fee also known as a hurdle rate is usually calculated on profits above a certain level of return, another widely used feature is the so-called high watermark.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                This is the highest net asset value or NAV that a fund has reached and for which a performance fee is paid setting a high watermark protects investors from paying fees on downside outperformance. It also ensures that they won't pay twice for the same
                increase in net asset value or NAV, in other words when high watermarks are in place fund managers must recover any losses before charging a performance fee on newly generated profits .
            </p><br>
            <p>
                These investment vehicles deploy a variety of strategies such as the use of leverage Rivet ifs and taking short positions hedge fund performance is measured either in terms of an absolute return for instance 15% or on a relative basis versus a benchmark
                index for instance 10, S&P 500 redemption turns to include a lock-up period during which investors cannot withdraw the money they have put in, a given hedge fund the notice period is also part of the redemption terms it usually lasts between
                1 and 3 months.
            </p><br>
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559067096-49ebca3406aa?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1031&q=80" alt="hedge fund ,investment">
            <br>
            <p>
                This restriction is posed for a reason it often happens that hedge fund need to exit and convert holdings into cash, the notice gives time. Hedge funds may have redemption fees intended to offset any transaction costs incurred in this process. Hedge funds
                provide access to a diversified portfolio and allow smaller investors to participate.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The four main categories of hedge funds are the event-driven relative value global macro and equity hedge funds event-driven strategies are supported various corporate actions like mergers acquisitions or restructuring entail taking long or short positions
                in equity or debt securities of the companies involved here we have a couple of subcategories merger arbitrage involve buying the shares of an acquisition takeover target and selling short the shares of the customer.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                This strategy is predicted to take advantage of the spread between prices of the respective shares or from potential overpayment by the acquirer the main risk involved here is that the deal may not close distressed or restructuring strategies involve
                investing in companies in financial distress or in other words firms that are about to file or have already filed for bankruptcy in such cases fund managers may choose to take it long or short position in the debt or equity securities
                of the distressed company. when taking a long position they bid on a successful restructuring thus they buy the company's securities at a discount and expect a profit from a price recovery, on the other hand, a short position is expected
                to be profitable in case of an unsuccessful restructuring when going short fund managers usually pick securities with lower investor protection like junior debt or common shares.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                These two approaches also can be combined by simultaneously taking an extended position in senior debt and a brief position in junior debt or equity, during this case, the hedge fund manager expects to take advantage of a rise within the price spread
                between the two classes of securities activist investing is another strategy based on triggering corporate actions activist hedge funds buy a sufficiently large shareholding in a company with the intention to influence its management they
                would require the implementation of various corporate actions and strategies to increase the company's value these may include divestitures restructuring capital distribution or changes in management activist investing resembles the approach
                of private equity funds in trying to gain control over a company .
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The key difference here is that activist investors focus on public companies lastly special situations funds invest in companies that are undergoing sort of restructuring other than mergers acquisitions in bankruptcy these include spin-offs asset sales
                and share buybacks okay great the relative value strategies they specialize in taking long and short positions in related securities and taking advantage of a short lived discrepancy in their perceived price relationship.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Again we've several subcategories here the first one is called fixed income convertible arbitrage it exploits any miss pricing of convertible bonds this strategy involves taking a long position in a convertible bond in a short position in the common stock
                of the same company asset-backed fixed income is another relative value strategy it uses opportunities that arise from mispriced asset-backed securities or abs and mortgage-backed securities or MBS general fixed income strategies exploit
                various pricing discrepancies within fixed income markets these may include relative value positions between two different companies.
