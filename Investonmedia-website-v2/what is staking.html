            <br>
            <p>
                In this, we will learn about a commodity called staking but first, you presumably want to check out the evidence of work agreement model which is the system that bitcoin uses to keep track of how important plutocrat everyone has it's a bit delicate to
                understand but once you get it this evidence of stake model which is veritably analogous will be much easier to understand.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                so what's evidence of stake well then is a text answer first and also i will explain it so easy that a five- time-old could understand evidence of stake is a blockchain verification system that's much further energy effective and less parlous than the
                more common evidence of work system only one miner is chosen at a time to validate the blockchain but that miner must lock up some of their coins as collateral to be chosen the miner is penalized for creating any fraudulent deals by losing
                their collateral and awarded for good deals by the creation of new coins and conceivably with the sale freights the senders paid .
            </p>
            <br> you will understand it by the end it took me a while to completely understand what evidence-of- stake is and i will try my stylish to put it into nonprofessional's terms for you guys first i am going to tell you why evidence-of- work
            sucks in fact we've evidence-of- stake to fix the effects that evidence-of- work sucks at so suppose of it like this in evidence-of- work let's say you have runners lining up for a race all eight racers are contending to the finish line but
            you have some racers that have an advantage given the quantum of coffers they've kind of like they've stronger legs or they weigh less or they have trained longer indeed though all racers get to the finish line ultimately only one person wins
            and they get the price which might be a candescent bitcoin while the other runners still had to run down the track and those who did not win basically wasted their energy for no price and with evidence of stake all the runners would line up
            at the starting line and also only a single racer would be named grounded on a many factors which we'll talk about then soon this way we do not waste electricity or energy and nothing runs without getting a price.
            <br>
            <p>
                when it comes to coins that use evidence of work like bitcoin numerous large mining companies contend to break a blocks award the fastest evidence of work also is not fair to the diy miners who do not have access to veritably important machines or super
                computers that can win the mystification working task the quickest with cryptocurrencies we want there to be lots of miners so that the coin is truly decentralized and so that the blockchain is safe if those large mining companies join
                together they could actually start making fake deals because the blockchain is a maturity vote if they get indeed your bitcoins farewell so this is a big problem and evidence of stake attempts to fix this by only opting one validator which
                is the word that evidence-of- stake cryptocurrencies call miners the validator or the miner also gets to break the mystification and earn the price while other validators double check them it's a lot more fair this way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611647832580-377268dba7cb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=870&q=80" alt="reward, prize">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                one crucial thing when it comes to evidence of stake is that since only one validator is named it's veritably important that they break it rightly because else they'll have to elect someone additional stay for them to break it rightly and it just takes
                a lot of time and in the crypto space time is plutocrat so to break this problem we make sure that those partakers lock up some of their coins and also other validators can actually double check their work and if those validators were
                wrong we punished them and take some of the coins that they locked up this process of locking up their coins as collateral is called staking.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                so in short to share in a evidence of workcoin you have to enjoy some of that coin also you lock it up so you can not use it and you stay so that the network will pick you to mine when you get picked if you mine rightly you get what is called a staking
                price generally some of the coin and if you mine inaptly you actually get punished and lose some of the coin that you originally locked up moving on the way that we elect who gets to be the validator is important too because in numerous
                cases evidence of stake coins will poison those who are staking the most coins because they've the most to lose but occasionally we also calculate in how long they've been locking up those coins because they've them and they have not lost
                them they are presumably making lots of good computations if we only elect them grounded on the age of their stake though or who has the most stake we'd presumably also intimately be turning the big and rich mining installations again
                and to break this we also add in a bit of a arbitrary number chooser.
            </p>
            <p>
                so now you might understand there is a good incitement for validators to rightly corroborate the blockchain and a good selection process to reduce energy waste.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                now that you kind of know how it works let's go over the pitfalls and prices so there is a many pitfalls when it comes to staking your cryptocurrency threat number one is that there is commodity called the locking period when you go to stake your coin
                it will be moved into what's called a locked state .
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                During this time you won't be suitable to move your coins you can not shoot them and you can not cash them out occasionally you have to lock them up for a certain quantum of time like perhaps a month minimum all the way up to a time this is a threat threat
                number two is specialized knowledge in nearly every case it's not as easy as just downloading some software and also pushing a button you generally have to know how to decode how to set up your computer to validate and how to accept prices
                into a portmanteau and if there is an issue you're responsible to fix it risk number three is validator commission so if you do not want to you do not have to set up the confirmation process yourself you can give your coins to someone
                differently who has the knowledge and outfit to do it these platforms generally bear a validator commission for the use of their computers and this commission could cut into your profit and they could run down with your deposit at any
                time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                we'd stake because you do get staking prices presently I am gonna go over four of the most popular staking cryptocurrencies the first one is tezos which rewards you around six percent of what you stake per time and coinbase does it for you you do not
                have to set up any of that process but they take around one and a half percent of it which lowers your monthly return to 4.6 alternate Cardano is another coin that does staking they will give out around four to five percent the algo coin
                prices you with around eight to ten percent a time and incipiently ethereum which is actually switching to ethereum2.0 could be over to fifteen percent but further reliably presumably around four to seven percent but this will not be for
                at least another time so evidence of stake has quite a many benefits over evidence of work but it has downsides too like it can abate DIY GPU miners who want to share without retaining a whole bunch of the coin.
